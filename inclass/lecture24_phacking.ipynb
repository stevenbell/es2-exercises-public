    "Now that we have tools for simulating random events, let's investigate a couple ways this can be used and misused.  The first is called \"p-hacking\", where a scientific study is set up in a way that makes a \"statistically significant\" result more likely.\n",

    "Let's look at one example, inspired by this [XKCD comic](https://xkcd.com/882/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Write code to do the following:\n",
    "1. Generate two sets of normally-distributed random data with the same mean and variance.  The first is the *control* and the second is the *test* set.\n",
    "2. Use a T-test (`scipy.stats.ttest_ind()`) to calculate the probability that any variation between these two data sets could be explained by chance.\n",
    "3. If $p \\ge 0.05$, then print out a result like \"we found no link between purple jelly beans and acne (p = 0.791)\".  If $p < 0.05$, print out a result like \"green jelly beans linked acne! Only 5% chance of coincidence!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've got this working, write a `for` loop to run this experiment for all of the jelly bean colors.\n"
