    "# Monte Carlo simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Back when we did the pendulum physics problem in project 3, we used numerical simulation to model the behavior of a deterministic system where the true equations were difficult to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll look at another sort of numerical simulation.  The problems we'll solve are not hard because the equations are hard, but because there is uncertainty in the starting state or some of the inputs.  While there are analytical methods for doing these calculations while tracking the uncertainty, it is often easier to simply try a whole bunch of scenarios at random and then see what the range of possible results are.  This is known as \"Monte Carlo\" simulation, named after the casino in Monaco.\n"
