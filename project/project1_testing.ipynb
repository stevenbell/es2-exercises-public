    "### The parameters of testing\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few important numbers that describe medical tests. The first is called *sensitivity*. It tells what fraction of sick people do in fact test positive. Of course, we would like our test to detect all sick people (i.e., sensitivity = 1), but that’s rarely possible in real life. When our sensitivity is less than one, that means we get some false negatives – i.e., the test gives a negative result but it’s mistaken.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second important number is the *specificity*. It tells what fraction of healthy people test negative. Of course, we want to have specificity = 1, but again that’s unlikely in real life. When specificity < 1, we get the occasional false positive – a healthy person winds up mistakenly testing positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "A well-run site using a high-quality Covid test (like we have at Tufts) may easily have sensitivity and specificity of .95 or higher. Does that mean our results are quite accurate? That’s what this lab will tell us."

    "### How the statistics work\n",
    "Let’s take an example. Assume that there are 10,000 people in our testing pool and 1% of them (100 people) are infected. Assume that we use a test that has 98% sensitivity and 97% specificity. Then consider the following table:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "<tr><th></th><th>Healthy</th><th>Infected</th></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>Test positive</td><td>297</td><td>98</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>Test negative</td><td>9603</td><td>2</td></tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "    \n",
    "Of the 100 infected people, our 98% sensitivity says that 98 people will correctly test positive and 2 will mistakenly test negative (i.e., a false negative). Of our 9900 healthy people, the 97% specificity says that 9603 will correctly test negative and 297 will result in a false positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at these numbers, we see that 98+297=395 people test positive. Of these, 98 are true positives (i.e., are actually infected). Thus, if you receive a positive test, then your odds of being infected are 98/395 or roughly 24%. Surprisingly low! (Of course, if, in addition to receiving a positive test, you also feel lousy, are running a fever and have lost your sense of smell then your odds of being infected are probably a whole lot higher).\n",

But suppose that each day you also have a 1% chance of getting infected without knowing it.  What is your limit of certainty?  That is, on any given day, how sure can you be that you do not have the illness? You can solve this analytically or with code; we’d love to see both!\n",

    "3. Conveniently, the numbers in this simulation worked out so that a whole number of people tested positive and negative.  But suppose that our initial sample had some other number, giving a fractional number of positive tests.  Clearly it doesn’t make any sense for 120.78 people to test positive, so what is the right thing to do with these numbers?  How would you modify the simulation so that it reflects the reality that individuals test either positive or negative?"
